# Image Overlay Preview — VS Code Extension

## What this is
A VS Code extension that replaces the built-in image preview with a webview that
displays EXIF / metadata as **unobtrusive glass overlays in the four corners**
of the image, instead of a sidebar panel that eats horizontal space.

Core differentiator vs existing extensions (Image Details, Image Metadata
Viewer, etc.): **image stays center stage, info is peripheral**. Sidebar-based
competitors compress the image; corner overlays don't.

## Architecture
- `src/extension.ts` — activation, registers the custom editor and commands.
- `src/provider.ts` — `CustomReadonlyEditorProvider`. Builds the webview HTML,
  sets CSP, wires `localResourceRoots`, and holds **session-scoped UI flags**
  (e.g. `histogramOn`) that need to survive a single-webview lifetime — the
  webview pushes back via `postMessage({ type: 'histogramToggle', value })`
  so the next image opened from Explorer inherits the state.
  Sibling enumeration is **off the first-paint critical path**: the HTML is
  assigned right after a single stat of the opened file (with `siblings: []`),
  the folder is then enumerated with parallel stats, and the sorted list is
  delivered via `{ type: 'siblings', siblings, currentIndex }` once the
  webview has posted `{ type: 'ready' }` (handshake so the message can't be
  dropped before the listener exists). Don't reintroduce awaits between the
  config/stat block and the `webview.html` assignment.
- `src/webview/main.ts` — runs in the webview. Responsibilities:
  - Load the image via `<img>`.
  - Parse EXIF/IPTC/XMP client-side with `exifr` (bundled into `dist/viewer.js`).
  - Render the **fixed-slot** overlay layout (TL capture / BL file / TR GPS /
    BR zoom). Slot assignment is no longer driven by emptiness ranking.
  - Sample corner luminance from a downsampled canvas to pick light/dark glass.
  - Browse siblings (`←`/`→`), slideshow (`Space` / `[` / `]`), zoom & pan,
    and a Web-Worker-based RGBA histogram (`H`).
  - Prefetch the prev/next sibling (`new Image()` + `decode()`, ≤2 cached)
    after each image settles, so browsing hits Chromium's memory/decoded
    caches. High-frequency input DOM work (wheel zoom, drag pan, corner
    proximity) is rAF-coalesced; `setOverlay` skips writes when the HTML
    is unchanged. EXIF loads are generation-guarded: `loadExif` /
    `enrichExifFromFormat` return objects and `onImageReady` commits them
    only if `state.loadGen` still matches (fast ←/→ can't cross-paint EXIF).
  - Bounding-box-aware cursor-near fade — measures the rect of each overlay
    so the expanded EXIF panel's larger footprint is handled correctly.
- `media/viewer.css` — glass-style overlay styling; uses VS Code theme variables
  as the page background but keeps overlay colors fixed for image readability.
- `src/webview/heic-worker.ts` / `src/webview/tiff-worker.ts` — persistent
  decode Web Workers (HEIC via `libheif-js/wasm-bundle` ~1.4 MB; TIFF via
  `utif`+pako ~84 KB min). Own esbuild entries, fetched lazily on first use
  of the format, then kept alive for the webview's lifetime — request-id
  protocol `{id,buffer} → {id,ok,rgba,width,height,hasAlpha}`, per-request
  error isolation, libheif image handles freed per request (they'd leak in
  a persistent worker otherwise). Main thread talks to them through
  `DecodeWorkerClient` (bundle fetched as text → Blob → `new Worker`, the
  same-origin trick; crash ⇒ reject-all-pending + lazy respawn).
- `esbuild.mjs` — four entrypoints: extension (node/cjs, `vscode` external),
  webview (browser/iife, bundles exifr), and the two decode workers
  (browser/iife). The histogram worker is **not** a separate entrypoint —
  its source is a string inlined in main.ts and loaded via `Blob` URL.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven CI that builds the vsix and
  attaches it to a GitHub release. See **Release process** below.

## Build
```
npm install
npm run build         # one-shot
npm run watch         # dev
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm test              # vitest run (single pass)
npm run test:watch    # vitest in watch mode
```
Outputs to `dist/extension.js`, `dist/viewer.js`, and `dist/heic-worker.js`.

## Tests

Pure helpers — formatters, EXIF/XMP interpretation, slippy-tile math —
live in `src/webview/lib/format.ts`. Tests live alongside in `tests/`
and run via vitest. The release workflow runs `npm test` between
typecheck and packaging, so a broken pure helper blocks shipping.

When adding parsing code that doesn't need the DOM (e.g., the planned
ISOBMFF box walker for HEIC/AVIF nclx and the PNG cICP chunk parser),
**put it under `src/webview/lib/` and write tests in `tests/` first**.
The webview's main.ts has too many top-level side effects (DOM lookups,
`acquireVsCodeApi()`, image-load wiring) to import directly into a test.

## Debugging
Open the project in VS Code, press F5 — launches an Extension Development Host.
Open any image file; the custom editor is `priority: default` so it replaces
the built-in preview. Use "Reopen With…" to switch back for comparison.

## CSP notes
Webview CSP is strict: `default-src 'none'`. The script nonce is generated per
resolve. Pieces that needed explicit allowance:
- `connect-src ${cspSource}` — `main.ts` does `fetch(imageUri)` to get the
  bytes for `exifr.parse` and TIFF/HEIC decode pipelines.
- `img-src https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org` — inline GPS map thumbnails.
- `script-src 'nonce-X' blob: 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` — `blob:` because both
  workers (histogram and HEIC) load from blob URLs;
  `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` for the HEIC worker, which
  `WebAssembly.instantiate()`s libheif's WASM blob.
- `worker-src blob:` is sufficient. We don't actually load workers from
  cspSource: webview-resource URIs are on a different origin
  (`https://*.vscode-cdn.net`) than the webview itself
  (`vscode-webview://...`), and `new Worker(url)` enforces same-origin.
  So the HEIC worker bundle is fetched as text and re-wrapped in a Blob
  before `new Worker(blobUrl)` — same trick the histogram worker uses
  with its inlined source string.

Don't loosen CSP further without a reason.

## Release process
**Fully automated since 0.3.3** — the Release workflow publishes the vsix
to the Marketplace via the `VSCE_PAT` repo secret (Azure DevOps PAT,
scope Marketplace→Manage, org "All accessible organizations"; the
`AADSTS5000225` tenant block that used to force manual uploads was
resolved 2026-07). If the secret is missing the publish step skips
cleanly and the fallback is the old manual upload at
`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/mcc`.

**PAT rotation:** the PAT expires (max 1 year). When the CI "Publish to
Marketplace" step starts failing auth, mint a new PAT (same account,
same scope) and update the `VSCE_PAT` secret under repo Settings →
Secrets and variables → Actions.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` drives everything. There's a one-shot
helper that runs the whole flow end-to-end:

```bash
# 0. Edit CHANGELOG.md and add a "## 0.1.2 — title" section. The workflow
#    extracts this section as the GitHub release body, so the heading
#    format must match: `^## <version> ` (space after the version).
# 1. Then:
npm run release            # patch bump
npm run release -- minor   # or minor / major
```

`scripts/release.mjs` does:
1. `npm version <bump>` — bumps package.json + creates the git tag.
2. `git push --follow-tags` — fires the workflow.
3. Polls `gh run list` until the matching CI run appears, then
   `gh run watch` to completion.
4. `gh release download <tag> --pattern "*.vsix" -D dist-release/` — pulls
   the freshly-built vsix back to the local machine (CI runs on Ubuntu,
   so the artifact has to come back over the wire).
5. Prints the Marketplace status — the publish itself already happened
   in CI; the downloaded vsix is a local archive copy / manual fallback.

If you'd rather drive each step manually:

```bash
npm version patch
git push --follow-tags
# ...wait for CI...
gh release download "v$(node -p 'require(`./package.json`).version')" \
    --pattern "*.vsix" -D dist-release
```

Pushing the tag fires the `Release` workflow:
1. Sanity-checks `package.json` version equals the tag (`v0.1.2` ↔ `0.1.2`).
2. `npm ci` → `npm run typecheck` → `npm run package`.
3. Slices `CHANGELOG.md` between `## <ver>` and the next `## ` heading.
4. Creates / updates the GitHub release with the vsix attached and the
   sliced section as release notes.
5. Publishes the same vsix to the Marketplace (`vsce publish
   --packagePath`). Skips cleanly when `VSCE_PAT` is absent, and skips
   when that exact version is already live — so `workflow_dispatch`
   re-runs stay idempotent.

`workflow_dispatch` is also wired up so a release can be re-built against
an existing tag without retagging — useful when the workflow itself needs
fixing or the vsix needs replacing.

**After the workflow finishes** the new version is live on both GitHub
and the Marketplace — `npx vsce show mcc.image-overlay-preview` to
double-check the live version.

## Format coverage

| Format | Renderer | Where in code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PNG / JPG / GIF / BMP / WebP / AVIF / ICO / SVG | `<img>` native | `loadImageInto` native branch |
| TIFF / TIF | `utif` Web Worker (~84 KB min, lazy chunk incl. pako) | `tiff-worker.ts` + `DecodeWorkerClient` in main.ts |
| HEIC / HEIF | `libheif-js` Web Worker (~1.4 MB, lazy chunk) | `heic-worker.ts` + `DecodeWorkerClient` in main.ts |

Both decode workers are **persistent** (spawned once per webview, request-id
multiplexed, `{id,buffer} → {id,ok,rgba,width,height,hasAlpha}`), so libheif's
WASM instantiates once, not per image. Decoded RGBA is presented **directly on
a `<canvas>`** (no PNG re-encode → `<img>` re-decode round-trip); `activeEl()`
abstracts img-vs-canvas for every pixel consumer (corner/alpha sampling,
histogram, applyTransform). Neighbor prefetch pre-decodes TIFF/HEIC into an
ImageBitmap cache (≤2 entries, ≤33 M total pixels, closed on evict). EXIF
parsing via exifr works on JPG / TIFF / HEIC / WebP regardless of renderer.

### HDR / color space surfacing
- ICC profile parse is enabled (`icc: true` in the exifr call) so the
  file card can show "Display P3" / "Adobe RGB" / etc. Falls back to EXIF
  ColorSpace tag when no ICC profile is present.
- HDR detection only catches what exifr can read out of XMP today —
  UltraHDR's `hdrgm:Version` and Apple HDR's `apple:HDREncoding`. AVIF /
  HEIC HDR (signalled in the `nclx` colour box) and PNG `cICP` chunks
  would need raw byte parsers we haven't written.

## Design decisions worth preserving
- **No sidebar.** That's the whole pitch. Don't add a sidebar panel even for
  "expanded" mode — use a larger corner card or a full-screen modal instead.
- **Auto-contrast per corner.** Each overlay samples its own background region,
  not the image average. A bright sky corner and a dark ground corner on the
  same image should get different treatments.
- **EXIF parsing happens in the webview**, not the extension host. Keeps the
  host light and avoids passing arraybuffers across the postMessage boundary.
- **Readonly editor.** Metadata editing (strip EXIF, etc.) is out of scope for
  v0 — Image Details already does that and we're differentiating on viewing
  ergonomics, not editing.

## What's deliberately NOT here
- No gallery / folder browsing view (vscode-infra's Image Viewer covers that).
- No gutter / hover previews (kisstkondoros covers that).
- No metadata editing or EXIF stripping.
- No AI / ComfyUI workflow parsing.

## Roadmap

### Shipped: v0.3.0 — Real wide-gamut / HDR detection

`src/webview/lib/iso-bmff.ts` (HEIC/AVIF nclx),
`src/webview/lib/png-chunks.ts` (PNG cICP / iCCP) and
`src/webview/lib/color-coding.ts` (H.273 enum → label) feed an
enrichment pass in `enrichExifFromFormat` (main.ts) that writes
synthetic `ProfileDescription` + `__hdrFormat` keys onto `state.exif`.
`describeColorSpace` and the extended `detectHdr` consume those
unchanged, so the file card now shows "Rec.2020 PQ" / "Display P3" on
files where EXIF ColorSpace was `Uncalibrated`.

If you need to extend this:
- Add another container? Pattern is the same: parser under `lib/`
  with vitest coverage, dispatched from `enrichFromBytes` (in
  `lib/format-enrich.ts`) on the file extension. Keep the pure
  parsers stateless so synthetic byte fixtures stay easy to write.
- Want to surface another nclx/cICP enum (matrix, fullRange)? Both
  triples are returned by the parsers — `format-enrich` just doesn't
  forward them today. Extend the synthetic-key contract before
  format.ts; don't reach into raw `nclx` from main.ts.

### Next milestone: nothing planned

Roadmap is open. See backlog below for candidate items.

### Backlog (no version pinned)

**Polish**
- [ ] Marketplace listing screenshots / a short animated GIF.
      User has to capture them; tooling pointer is ScreenToGif on Win.
      Drop into `media/screenshots/` and reference from README.
- [ ] Tests for `provider.ts`'s sibling sort comparator — same lib/
      pattern, extract the comparator into something importable.

**Maybe**
- [ ] Multi-image HEIC / AVIF sequence (burst photos) — show
      `1/4` frame counter, `[` `]` could double up to cycle within file
      when no slideshow is running. Conflicts with current slideshow
      keys, would need a different chord.
- [ ] PSD composite preview via `ag-psd`. Same lazy-worker shape as
      HEIC. Niche but small effort.

**Likely never**
- [ ] HDR-aware histogram. Canvas2D readback is 8-bit sRGB regardless
      of the source — would need WebGPU + float textures, much work
      for limited audience.
- [ ] RAW (CR2 / NEF / ARW / DNG / RAF). No good JS decoder; vendor
      formats are huge surface. exifr already pulls metadata from RAW
      so users can at least see capture info if they manually open one.
- [ ] JPEG XL. No native Chromium support, big WASM, niche.

### Known weirdness (not yet investigated / not fixed)
- VS Code side-by-side diff mode probably won't activate the custom
  editor (untested) — VS Code limitation, may be OK to ignore.
- The live-refresh watcher tracks only the ORIGINALLY-opened file:
  navigate to a sibling with ←/→ and overwrite THAT file on disk — no
  refresh (the fileUpdate handler even deliberately ignores it while
  navigated away). onDidDelete is also unwired: a deleted file keeps
  showing its last state. Both small, both by-design-ish since 0.1.x.
- XMP-only GPS (some tools write GPS into XMP instead of the EXIF GPS
  IFD) doesn't surface — exifr only populates `latitude`/`longitude`
  from the GPS IFD. Surfaced 2026-07-16 while diagnosing a "GPS missing"
  report (that one turned out to be stripped EXIF, not this).

## Competitive context (as of 2026-04)
| Extension | Display | Installs | Gap we fill |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image Details | Right sidebar | 349 | Eats horizontal space, old-school UI |
| Image Metadata Viewer | Separate HTML page | 1.2k | Table-dump UX, not inline |
| Image Metadata Inspector | Output panel text | 738 | Plain text dump |
| Image Viewer (vscode-infra) | Thumbnail grid | 88k | No metadata at all |
| Built-in VS Code preview | None | — | Only status-bar dimensions |
